Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. Collaboration with others would require a remote repository so that everyone can access everyone else's changes

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. You might want to always pull changes manually because pulling someone else's changes might break what you are currently working on.
