Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. Collaboration with others would require a remote repository so that everyone can access everyone else's changes

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. You might want to always pull changes manually because pulling someone else's changes might break what you are currently working on. 

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A. Forks are essentially clones within GitHub, and you would fork if you want to make changes where you didn't have permission to make changes to the original. Cloning is done when you copy the repository either from a remote to your local, or from local to local. Branches are used only within a repository.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A. First of all, you can compare, merge and resolve conflicts without internet access.

Q. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A. You could email commit, or use a could service like dropbox to sync the files, but without the tools like pull requests, forking, etc., it would be a lot harder to track commits and forks, and to communicate with collaborators without the pull-request tool.
